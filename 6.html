                                This activity i want to explain some populer types of attacks. There are a lot of types of it of course i can not explain all of them but i will try to explain most populer ones.
                                So first one is MITM ATTACKS (MAN IN THE MIDDLE). May be you can get what is is from the name there is a connection between server and client , somebody takes the place of middle of them and normally datas
                                must go to server but they go to man who takes positon in middle. We can divide 2 the MITM as active and passive. In passive mode attacker just watches and listens the channel without changing , altering anything.
                                So active mode is altering , capturing , interacting.
                            </p>

                                Let's give an example of it. You will buy new shoes , entered a shopping website with your unique creditials , you choose one and click buy button.
                                You are filling the necessary areas for buying (your credit card , id number,name,surname,your address...) normally all of this informations directly must go to server but somebody attended the position in the middle also 
                                that informations are going to him/her. Thanks to this method your informations can be stolen and you can have a problem your financial informations.There are good ways for protecting.
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/p2.png" alt="" /></span> <br>
                                First prevetion way is <b> using a VPN </b> There are many cyber security benefits of using a VPN (virtual private network), such as the fact that it masks your IP address by bouncing it through a private server.
                                VPNs also encrypt the data as it's being transmitted over the Internet. This doesn't make you impenetrable to MITM attacks.
                                The other way for prevention is the <b>Watching out for phishing scams</b> Attackers may use HTTPS spoofing or email hijacking to craft tailored phishing emails.
                                (I will explain it the Social Engineering activity.)
                                Other way is <b> Only visit HTTPS</b> websites As with VPNs, HTTPS websites encrypt data and prevent attackers from intercepting communications.So HTTPS are more secure.


                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Other populer method is <b>Brute Force</b> That takes much time. You can think the target is a door and you try to find the key with illegal tactics.
                                The keys are passwords to go deep. If the attacker find true password combinations , can go deep. (This method is hard for now because everybody choose password logically)

							<br>
							<p>
								And <b>Injection Method</b>  As you see from the method name it is about injecting malwares softwares or enter the (especially DBS) Inject fake reports , records etc.
                                    To prevent this method secure of db must be increase and check often , Users must choose good creditials (especially passwords)
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/inject.webp" alt="" /></span> <br>
								<br>
								The other method is <b> "FAKE WAP"</b> really funny while i was searching honeypots , i found it (actually similar with honeypots).
                                Attacker creates a fake wireless access point and when you connect it your ip address and other device , network datas have ben stolen 
                                by attackers , as you remember the similar logic with honeypots (Creating a fake web interface when you access it your informations go to third persons.)
